# 🛣️ Deep Learning Based Road Damage Detection

## 📌 Abstract
This research project focuses on automating the detection of road infrastructure damage (cracks, potholes) using Computer Vision and Deep Learning. The study involves a rigorous comparative analysis of **6 distinct CNN models** to identify the most efficient architecture for real-time deployment.

## 📊 Project Highlights
- **Dataset:** Curated and preprocessed **6,000+ images** of road surfaces.
- **Techniques:** Applied advanced **Data Augmentation** to handle class imbalance.
- **Models Benchmarked:** [Comparison of Custom CNN, Dense-Net-201, Efficient-Net-B7, VGG-19, ResNet50, MobileNet-V2, Xception]
- **Outcome:** Achieved 97.16% accuracy with the best-performing model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Google Colab
